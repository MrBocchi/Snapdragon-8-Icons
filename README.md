## Project Description

It all started when I wanted to write an article about the Snapdragon 8, but I couldn’t find high-quality assets for the Snapdragon SoC icons. So, I decided to create my own set.

The original assets are sourced from [Qualcomm Official Website](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms), and I optimized parts of the icons, such as the `Qualcomm and Snapdragon Logo at the bottom` and the `product model number display`.

The final icon pack (before 8 Elite) is all vector-based, so it can be scaled without loss when viewed in a browser. I also converted a `PNG version` and an `A4 printable version`. The PNG version is `2250x2250`, the largest size I could scale, with each file around 1MB, processed using Photoshop.
